N OTES. 95

For the occasion of this Ode see Ode 6, Introduction. Its
-oomposition has been severely criticized, but it is fair to re-
member that Horace would not himself have considered it 3 pure
lyric poem. It is an Ode written for public performance, and
is therefore distinctly rhetorical rather than poetica13 from this
point of view it has the considerable merit of being simple and
5131619 in its diction, and if, as in stanza 5, even Horace halts,
we may well pity the genial bard who finds himself compelled
to invoke a poetical blessing on legislation which his tastes
must have led him to dislike, and his common sense must have
despised as visionary.

Various editors give various methods of dividing the Ode
between the chorus of boys and that of girls. Thus much is
perhaps clear; that the first two stanzas are sung by the joint
chorus, the third by the boyS, the second by the girls; that
stanza 111116 15 sung half by boys and half by girls, that stanzas
10—15 seem to fau into pairs, and 50 suggest that they were
sung alternately by boys and gir1s; that stanza 19 is clearly
sung by all together.

They were in charge of the Quindecimviri (see 1. 70 n.); the
collection had been burnt in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus
Β. 0. 82, but had been re-formed. They were written, like all
oracles, in hexameter verse‚-and were no doubt frequently
forged when a convenient oracle was not found in the existing
collection.
