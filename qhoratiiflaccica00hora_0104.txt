CARMEN SAECULARE. .

‘O Phoebus and Diana, grant our prayer at this solemn
season when the Sibylline verses ordain that a chorus of youths
and maidens should chant a hymn to the gods who love the
seven hills (1-8). O life-giving Sun, ever do thou regard
Rome with thy favour, and thou, Ο goddess that bringest
children to the light, protect our mothers (9—16)‚ yea, and
give good success to the new marriage laws and increase to our
people‚ so that again and again throughout the ages they may
in full numbers celebrate this holy festival (17—24). And do
you, O ye Fates, determine for us a destiny in the future as
glorious as in the past: may the Earth yield her increase and
the Heavens drop fatness (25—32). Hearken to us Apollo,
hearkeu Ο Queen of Night‚ and, if Rome be indeed your
creation, and if under your guardianship the race of Troy has
been guided to greater destinies, then grant righteousness to
our youths, peace to our ehiers, prosperity increase and glory
to our nation (33—48). Chiefly fulfil his prayers for him who
is the glorious descendant of Venus and Anchises, the con-
queror merciful as he is mighty. His sway already the nations
own, already beneath his care our ancient virtues and ancient
blessings are returning (49—60). May Phoebus, if he regard
with favour the heights of Palatinus, grant another lustre,
another ‘age of abiding and ever-increasing happiness: may
Diana from her temple lend her ear to the prayers of the Quin-
decimviri and our vows (61—72). That this is the will of the

Immortals we carry home a good and certain hope, after duly
chanting the praises of Phoebus and Diana.'
