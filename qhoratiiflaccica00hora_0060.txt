50 ι HORAOE, ODEs 1v. iv.

53. crematofortis ab 1110] Though fortis in strict grammar
goes with pertulit yet in sense it goes with the words between
which it is placed: disaster, as the next three stanzas repeat
at length, but increases the eourage of the Roman raee:

‘bravely uittin -the ashes of Ilium storm-tossed on Tuscan
seas 13 saie] carried lt's sacred treasuresst

ducit, ‘draws‚' ‘derives‚' goes grammatically with gens, as do
the whole two lines, but the skill of the eomparison is shewn
in the fact that if ilex be taken as the nom. to ducit each word
is equally applicable.

*caedeffl can mean either‘ a cutting to pieces of troops, ‘a
military disaster, e. g. such as Cannae, or ‘the cutting off’ of a
bough: no English word will bear this double sense: perhaps

λ 'or‘ ravages 'will do.
e stanza is perhaps unrivalled as a specimen of Horace* s
unique power of terse and graphio expression.
