minis onera lyra sustinuit.

       
   

  

9. necm‘f‘nor has time blotted out whatever Anacreon's
sportive Muse composed of old.’ The poems of Anacreon
chiefly in praise of love and wine are of singular beauty:
they are best known to English readers through Moore’s
version of many of them.

si quid. lusit] Many intransitive verbs are allowed in poetry
to be used transitively in a secondary sense. So ludere here
and 1. 32. 2=⁴t0 write spogt-ivelyss ardere l. 13 ‘to be hotly in
love with,’ 1. 31 silere ‘to pass over in silence,' 2. 13. 26 so-
uare ‘to describe sonorously‚’ 2. 7. 24 deproperare ‘to make
hastily.'

11. vivuntque ..] ‘Still lives the p ssion entrusted to the
strings of the Aeolian iden,' i.e. qo'i''‘§a÷)Eho² who like
Alcaeus, was a native of ilytg‘ gne aifflc
dialect.

commissi] i.e. she made her lyre the confidante‚ as it
were, of her seoretS. Cf. Sat. 2. 1. 30, ille velut fidis arcana
sodalibus olim Ι credebat libris, of Lucilius and his books.

13. non sola...] For connection see Summary. ardere is one
of the many eonventional words: ‘to love‚' ‘fall in love with‚'
and arsit clearlygoverns the accusatives which follow, but they
are also partially governed by mirata. Translate ‘Not alone
has Laconian Helen been fired with love for the ordered looks
of an adulterer and his gold-bespangled robes, marvelling at
them and his regal pomp and retinue.'

Nauck, who says that arsit is intransitive and all the
accusatives are dependent on mirata alone, deserves to be
quoted. ‘Andere construiren arsit crines (eos mirata): soll sie
deun aber auch fiir die Begqleiter gebrannt haben ,⁹⁹
