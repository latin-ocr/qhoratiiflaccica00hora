62 HORAOE, ODES IV. vii.

genial day': note how skilfully the various periods of time
are introduced; not merely the changing year but each day,
each hurrying hour reminds us of the shortness of life. γ
almus is a natural epithet of day as opposed to darkness,
cf. Ca? Saee. 9, alme Sol: it is applied to anything that is life-
giving or invigorating (see 4. 41 n.): it is added here to suggest
a reason for our regretting each passing day. Wickham rendere
‘sunny’ and makes it refer only to summer days, but the lines
apply to the whole year and have no such limited meaning.

9. ver proterit...] ‘summer traniples upon spring and will
perish (in its turn) as soon aS... ἰ proterit, which would be
aceurately used of a mounted soldier pursuing, overturning and
trampling on an enemy (cf. Virg. Aen. 12. 330, proterit agmina
curru), here expresses the victorious speed with which summer
follows on spring, and suggests a fine contrast with interitura.

f 111. t effuderit] ‘poured forth' as from a Cornucopia or ‘horn

12: ³ 'inersff‘l’ ss ’ because in winter nothing grows and no
work canYe* done. e epithet by it‘s position draws marked
attention to the similarity between the end of the year and the
end of man’s little round of existence.

ffgglogsgl-—J‘the moon 111 the various months,' so soles 5. 7 and

14. ms] ‘lgm-we! The position of the word in the Latin
shews the contrast without the use of any adversative particle.
For the thought cf. the inimitable lines of Catullus 5. 4,

soles occidere et redire possunt.-
nobz's, quum semel occidit brevis lux,
nox est perpetua una dormientia.

15. quo...quo..,]sc.decider1mt ‘have fallen‚’ cf. Ep. 1. 6. 27,
ire tamen restat Numa quo U'evenit et Encas. For pater many
MSS. give pius .· it is difficult to decide between them, but it is
more probable that the ordinary epithet pius would be sub-
stituted by a copyist for pater than vice versa. The adj. clives
admits of no satisfactory explanation, and is deservedly
suspected by many editors.

‘pulvis, in the urn; umbra, in the under world.' Nauck.
