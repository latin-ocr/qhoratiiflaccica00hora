6. notas] ‘aecustomedssaluere‹sxv011en.² There 1S an old
reading, quum super ποταε saliere ‘when the rain· waters have
leapt over, ’which' is not so absurd as Orelli declares it to be.

7. fervet.. .] ‘So Pindar boils and-rushes measureloes
with deep utteranceffl

’ immensus and ruit clearly go together-3 cf. the Greek idiom
πολὺς ῥεῖ and Sat. 1. 4. 11, cum flueret lutulentus. The word
immensus is used in two ways, in reference, (1) to Pindar's
copiousness of diction, (2) to the unconstrained liberty of his
metres and movement, in both of which respects he resembles
a swollen torrent.

immensusque] Usually there is a marked caesura after the
5th syllable in a Sapphic line, and Horace rarely violates this
rule in the first Three Books: in this Ode however he does so
twelve times and six times in Ode 6. It would seem as if he
had come to be of the opinion that in long Odes the monotony

pf22the Sapphic rhythm required much variation, see too
11.

9. laurea...] Notice carefully that the construction is, do-
naudus, (1)εειι. ‚devolvit (2) seu canit ‚)(3 sive.. dicit.. ,et donat,
(4)j uvenemve.. plorat. Pindar is worthy of Apollo’ 5 bay m any
of the four kinds of lyric poetry mentioned. The sive in 1.17
ought to be answered by sive in 1. 21, instead of which we have
only ve, and that appended to the third word instead of to the
first. The obscurity is increased by 1. 18 where it is to be
carefully observed that the words puyilemve equumve, merely
explain quos: sire introduces the third great division of

Pindar's poetry, the words, pugilemve equumve, indicate the
two subordinate divisions into which it is itself divided.

10. per audaces dithyrambos] per denotes the channel
through which the words fiow, and keeps up the metaphor of
stanza 2, cf. also devolvit and-fertur. For δῖθύραμβος 566 Liddell
and Scott: as being sung at the altar of Dionysus it was often
very elevated, and indeed bombastic in style, and allowed the
introduction of unusual or extraordinary words (ποῖα verba).

11. numerisque. . .] ⁴ and sweeps along in num ers freed from
1aw.' As we do not possess any Dithyrambic Odes of Pindar
we cannot say how far this criticism is just: his Epinician
Odes exhibit a most careful system of Strophe, Antistrophe, and
Epode, though of course as compared with any metres used by
Horace they might seem ί161171655,’ much as Byron can speak
of Scott's ‘immeasurable measures!
