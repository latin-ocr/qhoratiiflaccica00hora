40 HORACE, ODES IV. ii.

is followed by te 111 an exactly parallel position at the com-
mencement of the next stanza, and any one has read Horace to
little purpose who has not observed that he is specially fond of
making his meaning clear by placing important and guiding
words, especially prononns, in emphatic positions: te in l. 53
would point back to te in 1. 49 as positively as concines in 1. 41
does to concines in 1. 33. Moreover, the whole of the latter
part of the Ode 15 an elaborately worked-out antithesis between
Antonius and Horace: ‘ Thou hast an important part,’ Horace
keeps repeating, ‘I a humble one ;‘ and the whole symmetry
and balance of this is mari-ed by the introduction of an
emphatic ‘Thou O Triumphl’ into the middle of it⁷ and
all in support of the theory that procedis can be used of
nothing but the triumphator or the triumph.

My view 15, Ι have since found, supported for the same
reasons by H. Schiitz: so too Nauck.

54. solvet] ‘Q' 1. e. from my vow. A person
who made a vow promised in case the god did a certain thing

for him to Ρη) the god a certain honour in retum. In this case
H01ace vitulum voverat pro veditu Auyusti; Augustus having

returned, he becomes* r sens& r s onsible for his vow;' the
offering of the cali wou im free from liis vow.’

55. Juvenescit] Lit. ‘becomes a juvenisss or, as here, a
juvencus ε ‘ grows up. ’

56. in‘ mea vota]‘ to a m vow. ’

57. fmteJ‘ nuth-Qadss which with the young horns

growing on it is said to imita e ‘the moon’ s crescent fire as she
brings round her third rising, ’i. e. the third after the new moon.

χ59. qua notam duxit] where it has got (or aoquired) a mark!

KQ λευκὸς ιὸεΐν, the infigi tiae is* e exe etio.
Cf. 6. 39 11.Εῷ

Μαι 60.1ἰι1νυ.5] contrasted with niveus; in Greek we should
have had μέν and δέ here.

It has been urged that there is considerable bathos in this

Ode, which began with Pindar and ends with the description ‚of

a calf, but it must be remembered that the penultimate stanza

carries on in an exceedingly natural manner the comparison

between Antonius’ greatness and the humbleness of Horace,

and the great repose and simplicity of the last stanza are quite

in accordance with the poet's practice of allowing a nervous

and brilliant Ode to sink into quiet and calm at its conclusion.
