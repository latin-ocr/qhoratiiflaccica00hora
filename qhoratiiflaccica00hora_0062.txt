52 HORACE, ODES IV. v.

This concluding stanza is clearly a part of Hannibal's pro-
phetie speech. Wickham says otherwise, urging that Horace
‘would hardly put into Hannibal‘s mouth a dull prophecy of
the glories of the house of Nero.’ But why, we ask, should we
put into the poet’s mouth this ‘dull prophecy’ which Horace
did not think good enough for Hannibal? As a matter os fact
the change from Hannibal to Horace at the end of a long
speech and that only for a single stanza is extremely harsh3 it
lowers the last four lines to the level of the moral usually
tacked on at the end of a versified fable. »

ODE V.

‘Return, great guardian of Rome, for thou hast been absent
too long: return, for thy presence is as sunshine, and thy
country longs for thee as anxiously as a mother for her sailor
lad's return. 'I'hy presence brings prosperity (17-21), purity
(21—25) and peace (25—29); every man lives under his own
vine, and after his evening meal honours thee with prayers and
libatione, ranking thee among his household gods. “Long
mayest thou preserve such joyous holiday time for Italy’'—such
is our morning and evening cryss

sense of assured peace and repose which characterize it.

uses a phrase which suggests both ideas: Augustus is at once a
proof of heaven's favour and himself of heavenly race.
