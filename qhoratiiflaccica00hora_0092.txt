82 HORACE, ODES 1V. xiii.

18. quid habes...] ‘What have ou left of
her who breathed assion ..?’ ille=that person, the person not
here Eut at a distance: therefore illius=‘h21; of ,loanpss i.e.
the old Lyce, the Lyce of former days, For the repetition of

ill ius see 4. 70 n.: the effect here is pathetic, but the pathos is
used to enhance the moekety.

20. surg-regat] By. s co e (συγκοπή, ‘a striking together')

1215*ka So 1.‘3}r:1-8“}uertiae, 2. 2. 2 lamnae.

21. felix] i.e.‘in the possession of my heart; it is in agree-
ment with Lyce ; post clearly of time, ‘after Cinara's death?

ngtgque...] (Queen of my heart after Cinara) ⁴ and
(quesfissbeaut QeQe (ngta) and-winning ΠΕ es’ (yratczrum
artium). ra arum artium is simply a gen. of quality (cf. 1. 15,
centum puer artium), and is put instead of an adjective, being

strictly parallel to nota. facies refers to the whole personal
appearance of Lyce.

The above explanation is so simple that I cannot understand
why Orelli and VVickharn follow Bentley in making artium yra-
tarum dependent on nota=⁴noted f0r‚’ and et=etiam, ‘and a
beauty noted also for her winning wiles! That et after
que ean=etiam certainly lacks proof, and the construction
notus artium they only support by the authority of od. 2. 2. 6,
vivet extento Proculeius aevo Ι notus in fratres animi paterni,
where animi is a simple gen. of quality: ‘Proculeius shall live
in fame⁷ beyond the span of life (Proculeius) of paternal affec-
tion towards his brothers!

The ,qr-atae artes are explained by Comm. Cruq., ‘artium
matarum facies dicitur quae oculis, nutu superciliorum, cervicis
volubilitate, capitis qratia, totius denique co‘rffls motu placeL'

 

24. servatura...]⁴ ‘though they mean to preserve Lyce to
1312ssss (parem 1s proleptic) the years o a poor o rfflen! Q
25. vetulae] This adj. is used of old age when it is spoken

of contefftuously. According to Hesiod, ἐννέα τοι ζώει ’γενεὰς
λακέρυζα κορώνη Ι ἀνδρῶν ἡβώντων.

28. facem] ‘torch,’ here used of the blaze of beauty which
kindles the fire of love.

For dLLan (dis-lapsam) ‘that has fallen asunder,’ i.e.
gradually asted awa ’ to ashes, some MSS. by a common
error read delapsam m emeres which would mean ‘that has
fallen down into ashes!
