THE EXPOSITOffi—“Mr Page's small volume will be found os
great value 1101 only to school boys, but to much more advanced
studeuts. It is not a hurried compilation but an original work; the
work of a scholar who knows the value of other meu's labours, but
whose own fmuiliarity both with classical and biblieal study enables
him always to form lus own judgment and frequently to adduce fresh
materIal. Greater praise cannot be given than to say it is quite on a
level with his edition of lIorace's Odes; and this praise is deserved.
We may borrow from his former work and apply to himself his own
(ει-11101301 of Nauck: ‘The notes are always very brier, very much to
the point, and very well worth consideration! More than this, there
occur once οι· twice suggestions of the very highest importance.’'
