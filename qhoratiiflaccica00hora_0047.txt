educit in astra...] ‘exalts to the stars and grudges the
gloomy grave (its prey).’ Odes 8 and 9 dwell at length on the
immortality which the poet alone can bestow. The accusatives,
vires, animum, mores, are governed not only by educit, but by
invidet: invideo takes an acc. of the thing begrudged, ancl a
dat. of the person 10 whom 0, g. hoc tibi invideo.

23. ΜΕ 1110ᾱο ue] Merely an alliterative phrase: ‘afterthe
manner and metho of.’ So Cicero, Tim. 1, has Car-nacho
‘more et modo disputata. Some editors say that mos refers to
natm-als modus 10 customary habits, but the distinction, even
if it can be established, is unimportant here.

30. uvidi] So called because of the alls of the Am'o there ’
(praeceps Anio, Od. 1. 7. 13), and the numerous rivulets into
which the stream divides below the falls (uda mobilibus

    

, pomaria rivis, Od. 1. 7. 14.)
Q 31. operosa...] Notice the perfection of the comparison: the

tiny bee laboriously fashions its honey-cell; the humble poet
frames his verse with equal toil.
