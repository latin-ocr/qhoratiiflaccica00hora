ODE IV.

‘Like an eagle that in his native strength quits the nest,
tries his powers of flight, then swoops down upon the sheep-
folds and even joins battle with a serpent, or like a young lion
as he appears to the doomed hind—such has Drusus appeared
in battle to the Vindelici. Defeated by his youthful skill they
have learned to their cost what hereditary power happily
developed can effect, what an Augustus can make out of a

” Nero. Brave sires make brave sons: all nature witnesses to

this truth, only at the same time innate powers need training
to prevent their decline. Of the bravery of the Neros let
Metaurus' stream bear witness and that glorious day of
Hasdrubal's defeat, the day which at last restored the fortunes
of Rome and made Hannibal prophetioally exclaim in his
despair: “We are like deer attacking wolves. The great moe,
that undefeated by disaster came from Troy to Italy, still, like
its native oak, the more it is lopped the more vigorously it
grows: Hydra-like it only becomes more formidable after each
defeat. Never again shall I send home the proud messages of
victory. Fallen, fallen all my hopes now Hasdrubal is dead.
The Claudian raee shall ever be indomitable: heav'en protects
them, and wisdom watches over them.'’'
