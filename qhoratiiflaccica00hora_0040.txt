30 HORACE, ODES IV. i.

ODE Ι.

Introductory. ‘Why summon me, Venus, to enter again
the lists of love? Ι am verging on fifty and not the man Ι
once was. It would be more seasonable for thee to lead thy
revels to the house of Paulus Maximus: he has a hundred
qualities which will make him thy worthy champion‚ and in
return for thy favours will dedicate to thee a temple. To me
love and gaiety have lost their charms. And yet, even as 1
write, I find the old emotions retain their sway, I betray every
sign of passion!

Horace professes that he‘ resumes his pen merely to
celebrate again the power of love: he thus endeavours to veil
his real purpose‚' which has been already explained.
