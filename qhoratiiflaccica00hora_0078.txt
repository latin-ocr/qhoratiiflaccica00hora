ODE IX.

‘Lest you (leem that these songs of mine will not live long,
remember that, though Homer has the foremost place, yet the
poetry of Pindar, Simonides and others is not forgotten.
(Poetry too it is which alone confers immortality;) Helen was
not the first of her sex who has burned with a guilty passion,
full many an Ilium has been besieged, many a brave man has
lived before Agamemnon, but all lie—'now forgotten in the grave,
‘unwept and unhonoured' because ‘unsung.’ Ι, Lollius, will
see that no such fate is yours: your good deeds shall never be
the prey of jealous forgetfulness. Yours is a soul foreseeing and
firm, bold to punish greed and guilt because itself superior to
greed, ever fit for the highest position in the state. Such is
the ideal man, not wealthy but knowing how to use the gifts
the gods provide, fearing dishonour more than death, ready to
sacrifice 1115 life for his friends or his country.’ ᾗ

rapacity he had always secretly practised being discovered.
There is an intrinsic improbability in a story which assumes
that so acute a judge as Augustus was so long deoeived in the
character of an intimate friend, and it is said that Velleius is
partial 10 Tiberius who had a personal grudge against Lollius
(Suet. Tib. 12). Pliny accepts the story as true, possibly

because it gives him a welcome opportunity for moralizing Y. Ἴ ⁴

about Lollius’ grand-daughter Lollia Paulina, a great beauty,

who was married either for her face or her fortune by Caligula, 2

and who it seems would not unfrequently wear jewelry worth
over E300,000-whereupon Pliny very finely: Hic est rapi-
narum exitus, hoc suit, quare M. Lollius infamatus reyum
