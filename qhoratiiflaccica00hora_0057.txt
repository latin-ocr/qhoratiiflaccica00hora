NOTES. 47

Many critice cut out all from quibus to sed, and it certainly
is remarkable that sense and metre are thus left intact. ⁸ And
indeed, such lines as these, with their recondite allusion to
a small point of antiquarian lore and their parody of Horatian
philosophy in 1. 22, are just such as a copyist might have
interpolated. Wickham however defends them, because “the
faults of the verses are such as the poet is much more likely to
have been guilty of than an imitator'’1 It certainly needs a
subtle appreciation of Horace’s style to understand why the
“ fault& of these lines seem peculiarly Horatian.

22. sed] ‘but' i.e. to resume ‘however’2 so in Greek, δ’ οὖν.

23. victrices...] ‘conquering hordes Q

by the plans (i. e. strategy) of a youth.’
24. iuvenis] He was-23 years old.

25. sagei-e] ‘felt ΞΩ their cost,’ a favourite meaning ofssthe
word in Horace3 cf. Od. 2. 7. 10, Philippos et celerem suyaqhsemzy
3. 5. 36, lora sensit; 3. 27. 22, sentiant motus Orientis* uStrz'.

mens] ‘mens ad virtutes ἰητεῑὶίῃεηῐίαε, sayacitassm, pm-
dentiam‚ indoles ad animi virtutes, fortitudinem, clementiam,
fidem pertinet? Orelli. ’

rite] Sc. nutrita, ‘what a mind (duly nurtured), what a,
disposition duly nurtured beneath an auspicious roof could
effect)

rite, faustis, and penetralia are all religious words designedly
used to suggest the almost godlike qualities of Augustus.

Some editors place a comma before instead of after rite
spoiling the rhythm and not improving the sense.

27. quid Augusti...] These words specialize and so explain
the ⁸qeneral language of the preceding lines: ‘ yse, what Augustus
could do for the Neros.'

29. fortes...] The mention of Augustus’ care and the great
name of the Nerones naturally lead Horace to develop the two
great ideas of the Ode, (1) in lines 29-33, the necessity oi
hereditary qualities, (2) in lines 33—37 the necessity of good
education to develop them: he then illustrates the former of
these at length in lines 37—72, and briefly alludes to the second
in the concluding lines. This disproportion in the length of
treatment is natural: the advantages of education afford little
scope for a lyric rhapsody; while the mention of great ancestors
gives opportunity for introducing a brilliant historical fiction.
