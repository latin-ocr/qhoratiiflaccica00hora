felices errore suo, quos ille timorum

maximus haud urgyet leti metus, inde ruendi

in ferrum mens prona viris animaeque capaces
, ‘mortis et ignavum rediturae parcere vitae.

ODE XV.

‘When Ι thought to tell of wars and warlike eoncmests,
Phoebus struck his lyre to warn me against venturing on so
wide a sea. And indeed, Caesar, the most glorious triumph of
thy life is the establishment of universal peace. Peace bath

the family board, it shall be our detht, after prayer to the gods,
to sing of the glorious dead, to sing of Troy and Anchises, and
of thee the last and greatest of that heaven-descended race'

in a more homely manner, Ecl. 6. 3, cum canerem reyes et

haec eqo cum canerem, subito manifestus Apollo
movit inauratae pollice fila lyrae.
