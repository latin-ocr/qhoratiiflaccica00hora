ODE XIV.

This and the following Ode are closely connected: the one
dwells on Augustus’ victories in war, the other on his triumphs
in peace.

‘How shall senate and people worthily immortalize thy
ments, O Augustus? But lately the Vindelici have been
taught thy prowess in war, for it was with thy troops and
under thy auspices that Drusus overthrow the Genauni and the
Brenni, and that afterwards Tiberius joined battle with the
Rhaeti. On him every eye was fixed as he careered irresistible
over the field of battle; like to the Souis-h tvm-d when he sweeps
over ocean at the equinox, or the bellowing Aufidus when with
swollen torrent he threatens inundation, was the onset with
which he broke the mailed ranks of barbarians and, his own
troops uninjured, carried carnage and conquest far and wide-
yes, because thou didst furnish the forces, the forethought and
the favour of the gods. For it was fifteen years from the day
when Alexandria yielded to thee that prosperous fortune added
this crowning glory to thy past campaigns Now all the world
owns thee its master at peace beneath thy sway, while Italy and
imperial Rome enjoy thy guardianship and thy presence.'
