Judah and Israel dwelt safely every man under his vine and

under his fig-tree,' also Zech. 3. 10.

Certain trees were cultivated for growing vines upon, especla y
elms: others which were not so used are spoken of as
‘bachelors,’ cf. Od. 2. 15. 4, platanusque coelebs ξ evincet
ulmos. Here viduae is used of the elms which are only waiting
till they are grown up to be ‘wedded' to the vine. Cf.

Shakespeare, Com. of Errors, 2. 2,

‘Come, 1 will fasten on this sleeve of thine:
Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
W'hose weakness married to thy stronger state
Makes me with thy strength to communicate.’
