64 HORACE, ODES IV. viii.

ODE VIII.

‘I would gladly present my friends with goblets and bronzes,
Censorinus, and you should not have· the poorest gift, that is,
of course, if Ι were the rich possessor of such works of art.
But neither do Ι possess, nor do you care for such rareties.
You love song and song Ι can give, yeS, and I know the value
of the gift. The Sci-pios owe more to Ennius than to their
monuments and their exploits. Where‘- would be the fame m
of Romulus and Aeacus if it were not celebrated in verse?
The Muse alone confers immortality: it is through her that
Herculea the Dioscuri, and Bacchus are enthroned among the
immortalsx

In this and the next Ode it is probable that, though Horace
addresses Censorinus and Lollius, his words are meant for
Augustus. The Poet-Laureate hints pretty broadly to the
Emperor that he is well aware of the value of the favour he is
bestowing in writing this Book at his request.

Censorinus was consul 13.c. 8, and Vell. 2. 102 speaks
of him as clemerenclis hominibus natum, ‘born to win men.‘
