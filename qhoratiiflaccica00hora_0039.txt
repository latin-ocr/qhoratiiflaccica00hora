NOTES‘

The Fourth Book of the Odes is separated from the pre-
ceding three by a considerable period of time. In the con-

cluding Ode of the Third Book Horace distinctly speaks of his ἐν ss ’“ ³ ,
labours as a lyric poet as concluded: the first word os the “ “

present book calls marked attention to the interval which has
elapsecL and the Ode generally suggests that the poet resumes
his task somewhat against the grain. The reason for his
doing so at all is definitely assigned by Suetonius to the direct
command of Augustus: Scripta eJ'us usque adeo probavit
(Augustus) mansuraque perpetuo opinatus est ut non modo saeculare
carmen componendum injunxerit, sed et Vindelicam victoriam
Tiberii Drusique privignorum suorum, eumque coeyeric propter
hoc tribus carminum libris esc longo intervallo quartum addere.
Indeed it is sufficiently clear even on a cursory examination
that the rest of the book is only published to afford a plausible
pretext for the publication of Odes 4, 5, 14 and 15: the other
Odes‚ which are of a purely lyric character, serve to mask the
distinctly political purpose of these four, which bear on every
line the stamp of the official utterance of a Poet-Laureate.
