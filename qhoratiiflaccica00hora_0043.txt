ODE H.

‘To attempt to rival Pindar 15 like the attempt of Icarus to
fly. He 15 like a mountain-torrent swollen by the rain, rushing
and roaring along with deep-mouthed thunder. He is the
prince of poets whether he composes dithyrambs, ans,
hyffins of vigtory or dii-rges which make the fame of the dead
undying. He like a swan soars into the sky, I ani but like a
bee laboriously gathering a little honey. Yon, Iulus, are more
fitted in statelier strains to sing of the return of Caesar from
his triumphs over the Sygambri—Caesar the greatest blessing

P. H. ’ 1v. 3
