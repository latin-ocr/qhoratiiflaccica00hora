with a box of nard and then you shall have the best that is to

Sat. 1. 5. 41, the optimus Virgilius of Sat. 1. 6. 55, we shall
be able to appreciata the taste of those who here consider that
Horace, in a book published after his death, can speak of him
as the ‘client of noble youth5,’ and sneeringly hint at his
meanness and fondness for money-making! Martin adopts
this view which is worthy of his translation of the Ode.
