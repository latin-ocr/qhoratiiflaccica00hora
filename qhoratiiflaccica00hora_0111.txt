NOTES ΟΝ THE METRES USED IN THIS BOOK.

The Alcaic is so called from the Greek poet Alcaeus of
Lesbos, who is said to have invented it. It is employed by
Horace more frequently than any other metre, and is especially
used when a lofty and dignified tone is assumed, being there-
fore selected for Odes 4, 14 and 15 which are of a strictly formal
character. The ninth Ode is also in this metre.

:-v--fffl..vv..v: ω’

The first syllable of the first three lines is common, but a

{liprb syllzlable is very rarely used, and no instance occurs in
is oo .

The last syllable of each line is common: in the third and
fourth lines however a final short syllable is distinctly rare,

such an ending not having sufficient weight. Exceptions are
4, 19, 67; 9, 16, 43, 51,

Synaphaea prevails: that is to say, a line ending in m or a
vowel or diphthong is rarely followed by a line beginning with
a vowel, the lines in each stanza being ‘linked together '
(acvdjrrw). The only exception in this book is 15, 10 licentiae!
m εστι. e

J In the first two lines a break always occurs after the fifth

syllable, but 14, 17 spectandus in cerltamine Martio is a re-
markable exception.

The third line bears the weight of the stanza and is very
carefully constructed. These are model lines:

permisit Ι expertus Ι fidelem 4, 3;

“ lateque Ι victrices Ι catervae 4, 233
devictus Ι et pulcher 'sumtis 4, 393
ηε parva Ι Tyrrhenum Ι per aequor 15, 35
