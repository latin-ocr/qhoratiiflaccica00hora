a rendering.

mother's u der.⁷ The awkwar‘ness of the original does no
appear in English. Either matris ab ubere depulsus or lacte
(apulsus would be excellent Latin, but the expression matris

ab ubere lacte depulsus is extremely harsh, and the harshness

is not got rid off by saying that lacte depulsus is virtually one
word = ἀπογαλακτισθέντα, ‘ weaned.'

There is much to be said for Nauck’s method of placing a
comma after ubere: the young roe-buck fresh from its mother’s
side, as it seeks its food, suddenly finds itself face to face with
the newly-weaned lion, as it seeks its prey: the comparison is

certainly very complete. fulvae in this case refers to the
colour of what we might call ‘red deer.'

This remarkable parenthesis seems intended to give local
colouring and an appearance of reality to the Ode. The
a1tifice produces an effect almost as natural as the introduction
of an claborately painted insect into the foreground of a boldly

treated landscape. The bathos of the conclusion ‘nec scire sas
est omnia transcends criticism.
