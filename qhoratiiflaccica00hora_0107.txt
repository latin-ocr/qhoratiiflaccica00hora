N OTES. 97

referatque] As regards the position of que, it is probable
that the full phrase would be ut cantus (referat) reseratque
ludos, and that the first referat is then omitted. The position
of que is however very common in poetry, clearly because it is
convenient, 1. 30. 5, Gratia properentque Nymphae, 2. 19. 28,
pacis eras mediusque belli, 3. 4. 11, ludo fatiqatamque somno.

23. ter] Three was a sacred number with the ancients,
cf. 1. 28. 36, injecto ter pulvere, Soph. Ant. 431, χοαῖσι τρισπόν-

δοισι, and the number of the chorus here consiste of thrice nine ⁷

youths and thrice nine maidens.

24. frequentes] Emphatic: the prayer is that they may
be numerous.

25. veraces cecinisse] ‘ever truthful in your oracles ἐ
canere is continually used not only by the poets but by prose-
writers of oracular utterances, the oracles being delivered in
verse, cf. 1. 15. 4, caneret fata. The inf. is epexegetic, and the
perfect is used accurately: the Parcae have been found truthful
in their past utteranceS‚ and this is the ground of confidence in
their promises for the future.

26. quod semel.. .] Wickham with most recent editors* is
clearly right' 111 preferring the less commonplace and somewhat
more difficult servet, which has strong MSS. authority, to Orelli' s
sev-&vat ‘Ye Fates, ss has been once appointed, —and so may
the abiding landmark of our fortunes preserve it-link happy
destinies to a happy past.’ Supply bonis with peractis,

The construction of quod with dictum est is its ordinary
construction in parentheses=id quod, and stabilisque is put
briefly for quodque stabilis...‚ the idiom being that so frequent—
ly found, e.g. in such phrases as Ego, Patres Conscriptz', qaod
felix faustum fortunatumque sit, ita censeo.

Orelli makes quod...servat acc. after cecinisse, but the sense
‘truthfui in having foretold what has been once for all decreed
and what (consequently) the abiding landmark of things
preserves’ is poor and pleonastic to the last degree.

stabilis rerum terminus] 111 using the phrase ‘abiding land-
mark of our fortunes,’ Horace is clearly referring to the
popular legend that, when space was being made for a temple
of Jupiter on the Capitol, the god Terminus (see Class. Dict.
s. v.) alone refused to make way, thus symbolizing the eternal
stability of the Roman state. The Romans regarded ‘bound-
stones' with peculiar reverence: the citizen who removed one
was held accursed (cf. 2. 18. 24, Merivale 0. 33, and Deut.
