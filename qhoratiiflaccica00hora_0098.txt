proroyare imperium. Just as the senate for a favourite or vic-
torious general (proroslabat imperium) ‘granted an extension
(pro) of his command,' so Fortune for her favourite Augustus
‘granted this additional (ad) glory to his past commands’
(decus peractis imperiis arroyavit).

45. te...1ster] Wickham rightly points out that, though the

- adjectival clause fontium qui celat orz'yz'nes applies primarily to

the Nile, yet ‘the position of the copulatives seems to shew that
the Danube is included.’ This view, which the construction of
the sentence supports, he further justifies by a quotation from
Seneca, Quaest. Nat. 4. 1, who compares the Danube With the

⁸Nile, quod etsontes ignoti et aestate qnam hieme ηιαίον sit.

47. berus] cf. Od. 3. 27. 26 γεοαῃςζξτ ειη belms pontum.
The adj. 15 only found here, and is pei aps imitated from the
Homeric μεγακητης. Cf. too Ps. 104. 25, ‘the great and wide

sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, bgoth small and
great beasts!

remotis] The inhabitants of Britain are to Virgil and Horace
simply types of remotest barbarism, cf. Virg. Ecl. 1. 67, pem'-

‘no-3, 3. 4. 33, Britannos hospitibus seros. Augustus never visited
Britain thousrh he proposed to do so in B. c. 34 and 27. See
