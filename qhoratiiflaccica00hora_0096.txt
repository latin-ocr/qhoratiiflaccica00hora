86 ¹ HORACE, ODES IV. xiv.

spectandus ‘⁸‘ ’Ἰψὼῶ-ΜΕἘΠΜΜΘ
’ harassed hearts e ica e to the death of freemen.’ Wickham

1³:

however considers it a Greek construction:0avuacrbs...‹‘>¹o·ocs.

18. devota...1iberae] Horace, with true Roman indifference,
merely mentions this quality to 6111161166 1116 glory of Tiberius.

20. in tas] ‘unconquerable'z the adj. suggests 6 com-
parison xvit 1 1116 description of the Rhaeti in 1. 18.

'‘prmoe qua-135...] The construction is prope qualis Auster
exercet unclaS...(tali modo) impiger vexare turmas.- ⁴ almost as ,
1116 South wind when he frets the waves...(even 50) unwearied to
harass the squalhons of the foe and dash his snorting steed....' '

prope: the introduction of this modifying word before
qualis 15 very remarkable. Metaphors, similes and the like
are in their proper place in Poetry, in Prose they are not:
consequently Prose-writers always introduce them with
apologies and qualifications Poets rarely 01· never. A com-
parison 111 poetry that needs either qualification or apology
is sels-condemned. To compare Tiberius to the South wind
may be either good or bad poetry: but for a poet to say
⁴ Tiberius is almost like the South wind’ is positively to suggest
to the reader that he is himself conscious his own comparison
is ‘almost’ what it should be, but not quite, It is but fair
however to Horace to remember that this Ode is written to
order: any one who has written 6 ‘Prize Poem’ may appreciata
what agonies such comparisons as this and the one in Ode 4
must have eost him, indeed I am not quite sure that the prope
is not inserted of malice prepense.

21. exercet] ‘keeps at work,’ then *116 565 ’ ‘annoys’

Pleiadum...] The Pleiades rise and 56 a out the time of
the& 1111101165, and therefore of the equinoctial 36165. Horace
speaks of them* as ί016ἓν-1ἡ113 thgclouds’ because he 15 thinking
of the cloudy stormy weather whffih accompanied their rising
and setting when they would be only seen fitfully and occa-
sionally through rents in the clouds.

23. vexare] '‘Epeg'egetic infigitive. θ’(

24. medios per ignes] Be careful of rendering ‘through
the hottest of the fire.' By comparing Epist. 1. 1. 43, per
saza, per iqnes and Sat. 2. 3. 56, ίῃηεε per medios fluviosque
ruentis (of a madman), we 566 that the expression is prover-
bially used of passing through any great danger, just as we
talk of passing ‘through fire and water.' Wickham rightly
