N OTES. 85

esteerned and worthy of the senators. It was the title by
which Augustus chose by preference to be designated: cf. Tac.
Anu. 1. 1, cuncta...nomine principis sub imperium accepit, and
Od. 1. 2. 50, hic ames dici pater atque princeps. The word
certainly does not mean in Horace’s time ‘a prince' or
‘sovereign‚’ and therefore maxime principum must be taken
as=maxime princeps, and it is clearly impossible to render
this accurately in English.

The term arx, which the ancients derived ‘ab arcendo‚’ was
used of any ‘place of defence⁷ situated on an eminence.
