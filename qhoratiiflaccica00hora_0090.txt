ODE xm. ᾧ

 

‘The gods have heard my prayers: you are becoming old
and ugly, Lyce, and yet you stin aet like a young girl, and seek
to awaken love. Loye prefers fair chloe’s cheeks, and rudely
wings his flight past wizened age, to which no ornaments can
bring back its former eharms, the charms which once stole my
heart from me, when you succeeded Cinara as the queen of my
affections. A1as, poor Cinara, the fates cut her off in her youth,
while you they preserve to a fabulous age that the young men
may saofi at the ashes of your beauty.

The lOth Ode of the 3rd Book describes the cruelty and
pride of Lyce in her youth3 this Ode is a. sort of sequel to it.
