66 HORACE, ODEs IV. viii.

rivalled exploits offixfrioanus have not done more for his fame
than the v es ome ossjecmons to the text are many.

Some editors have glaxely urged that the ‘burning of
Carthage’ can refer to some minor event such as ‘the burning
of the camp of Scyphax’ (Liv. 30. 5), or that ‘burning’ is put
‘poetically⁷ for ‘disaster.' I only mention these explanatione
as a useful warning to the student and as serving to shew to
what almost disingenuous shifts commentatore will resort, who
have an unreasoning reverence for their author’s text.

VVickham makes a suggestion which is at any rate ust
possible. He suggests that Horace is thinking not so 11111011 of
the elder Scipio personally as of the fame of the name ‘Afri
0011115,’ ‘ eius...rediit⁷ being merely a periphrasis for that name.
Horace then asks ‘What throws most glory on the name of
Africanus, Zama and Oarthage, or Ennius’ poetry?⁷

(2) The genitives Karthaginis impiae followed immediately
by the genitive eiua which has no connection with them but
goes with laudes, are very awkward.

Moreover the pronoun is, doubtless as being considered weak
and unemphatic, is almost absolutely ignored by the Roman
poets : Virgil very rarely uses it: in the Odes it is only found here
and in 3. 11. 18, a passage of extremely doubtful authenticity.
In any case it could hardly bear the strong emphasis here
placed upon it.

(3) There is no Ode of Horace which does not admit Qt'
division into stanzas. As at present constituted this Ode con-
sists 01 33 Iines and cannot be so divided——a formal but,
ffififf‘ffiffil oss'ection to the text.

Some editors mark a lacuna of two lines after 1. 17, others
omit ll. 17 and 28 as spurious. That some alteration is needed
there can be no doubt; what it ought to be is a matter of pure
con'ecture.

JI translate the text: ‘nor does the burning of unholy
Carthage more brightly point out the renown of him who re-

111111οᾶ having won a name from conquered Africa than do the
Muses of Calabria..
