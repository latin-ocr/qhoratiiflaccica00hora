Horace tells Lollius, who had actually been consul Β.0. 21,
that ‘his soul is ever consul‚’ i.e. though he no longer wears the
externa] insignia of that office, his soul proclaims its real dig-
nity and unchanging rank whenever it prompte him to aet with
true nobilit .

Bentley {notes a quantity of phrases which shew that the
phrase animus consul would not be as novel to a Roman ear as
it is to 110, e.g. animus carnifex, censor, dominus, rex, liberator.

Ι (10 not agree with those who say that, there being four
lines between animus and consul, the reader should ‘forget' the
word animas when he comes to consul and supply ‘Lollius'
instead, for the whole point oi what Horace says is that, though
Lollius himself is no longer consul, yet his nobility of conduct
makes him ever a consul in soul.

41. honestum utili] These two words are often used in the
neuter in Ethical treatises almost as substantivas, like the
Greek τὸ καλὸν and τὸ συμφέρον. They express the two great
ends with reference to which moral conduct may be reguhated,
viz. right and expediency. We do a thing because we think it
either right (honestum) or expedient (utile).

46. recte] with vocaveris; beatum preclicatively: ‘you will
not ri htly call blessed.' There is a play on the word beatam
in 13Ηο Datin: 1tHas two meanings, (1) ‘happy,' (2) a conven-
tional meaning=‘well off‚' ‘wealthy.' The owner of large
estates is popularly called beatas, but according to a more
correct standard (recte) he often does not deserve the name.
As it happens the English word ‘wealth' which originally
meant ‘general well-being’ (e.g. in the Litany, ‘in all time
of our wealth’) has been confined to the special sense of being

{v7ell ἕξ in worldly goods. Of. for the whole passage Od. 2. 2.

48. sapienter] ‘wisely’: the word sapiens is frequently put
= ‘a philosopher,⁷ φιλόσοφος, but here the adverb: σοφῶς and
indicates the action of one who not only acts rightly, but acts
so consciously and on principle as the true‘ wise man' should.
