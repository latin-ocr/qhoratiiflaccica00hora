102 HORAOE, ODEs IV.

and these variations are frequent:
quantis {fatigaret Ι ruinis 14, 193
cum saevit Ι horrendamque Ι cultis 14, 273
vexarei turmas Ι et frementem 14, 23.

In this book it never ends in a monosyllable, or two
dissyllables or a quadrisyllable.

The fourth line cannot begin with two dactyls without
caesura: nobilis Ι omnio Ι dixit Ι ille is not a line.

In the second dactyl the weak caesura is rare, doubtless as
giving the line too rapid a movement. An instance occurs 9, 8

Stesichorique yraves Camenae.

The Sappnic stanza is so called from Sappho the Greek
ἕεᾶῖξῖεῖῗῶί Lesbos. It is used in Odes 2, 6, 11 and the Carmen

First three lines ----- ΙΙ υ υ - v - ε stadam-4 esm-

Fourth line - ν ν - C

Synaphaea prevails: in no case is a line ending with a
short vowel followed by a vowel at the beginning of the next
line in the same stanza. A dubious instance of a vowel follow-
ing a vowel occurs 2, 1 aemulari Ι ille.

The close connection between the lines is shewn by the
fact that elision can take place between them, as 2, 22
πιονεεΙραε aureos; 2, 23 7zi9rolque invidam C. S. 47prolemlque
et decus, and by such a line as 6, 11 collum in Ι pulvere.

In the first three lines a break usually occurs after the fifth
syllable. To this rule there are six exceptions in the First
Book, one in the Second, none in the Third, but twenty-two in
this Book and nineteen in' the 76 lines of the Carmen Saeculare,
e.g. in each line of a stanza ll. 53-55

jam mari terraique manus potentes
Medus Albanaslque timet secures,
jam Scythae respons1a petant, superbi.
