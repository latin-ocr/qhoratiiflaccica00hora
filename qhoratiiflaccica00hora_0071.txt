again, whereas the waning moon soon recovers her ffflness,

4. praetereunt] ‘pass by,’ i. e. cease to overflow.

represented as inseparable, cf. 3. 21. 22 seques nodum solvere
Gratiae: here Gratia cum yemim‘s sororibus: ‘the three
Graces.’ Their names were Aglaia, Euphrosyne and Thalia.

7. annus] Probably of the same derivation as anulus or αη-
nulus ‘a ring‚⁷ and therefore conveying the idea of ‘the revolving
year.' et almum... ‘and each hour which hurries away the
