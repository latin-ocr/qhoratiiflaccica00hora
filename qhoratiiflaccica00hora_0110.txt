100 HORAOE, CARMEN SAECULARE.

and peace, and that possibly the rhythm of the lines is intend-
ed to represent this.

59. pleno copia. cornu] For Copia personified with her
horn of plenty (our ‘cornucopia‚⁷ beni-quum cornu, 2. 17. 16),
see Class. Dict. s. v. Amalthea.

62. acceptus] ‘welcome,⁷ ‘dean' Camenae here=simply
‘Muses,’ but see 4. 6. 27.

63. qui salutari...] Παιὰν, Παιώνιος.

65. Palatinas arces] With reference to the temple of Apollo
on the Palatine⁷ 'm which this hymn was sung, built by
Augustus B.c. 28, in memory of the battle of Actium, cf. 1. 31.
1. Many MSS. have ara3. aequus, ‘with favourable eye.’

66. felix] The run of the verse seems to point to this
{vagg {oing with Latium rather than with lustrum, as Orelli

67. lustrum] for Ζιιεινιινηει a space of five years ’ cf. 4. 14.
37 n. The reference is doubtless to the fact that Augustus,
at the conclusion of the 10 years for which he had originally
accepted the imperium, was in B.c. 18 inve-sted with it for a
further period of five years.

68. proroget, curet, applicet] Ι so read with hesitation in
preference to pror-oyat, curat, applicat. The MSS. authority is
fluctuating. The whole hymn has hitherto been a suppli-
cation, and the use of si in l. 65 seems to point to a continued
appeal, cf. its use in l. 37. On the other hand it is urged that
“the time for urgent prayer and expostulation is past: the
chorus has now assumed the tone of confidence and promise‚''
and that the assertion in the last stanza would be abrupt if the

prayer be continued to l. 72.

69. Algidum] Algidus is a mountain in Latium near
Tusculum. Diana is described as ‘rejoicing in it‚’ 1. 21. 6.

70. quindecim virorum] sc. sacris faciendis. They form-
ed a colle-qiam or ‘guild’ and had charge of the Sibylline books.
They originally numbered only two: Tac. (Ann. 11. 11) states
that they had charge of these games.

71. puerorum] ‘both boys and girl& in accordance with
the old use of puer for either sex) Wickham.

75. doctus] ‘trained‚‘ i. e. by the poet, who would-be χορο-
διδάσκαλᾳς, cf. 4. 6. 43, docilis modorum Ι vatis Horati. dicere:
epexegetic.
