cf. Ov. Fasti, 4. 187,

Scena sonat, ludique vocant. Spectate‚ Quiritem,
Et fora Marte suo litiyiosa vacent.

Many editors speak of this as a justitium .· it would seem how-
ever that a justitiam was only proclaimed in cases of national
calamity or danger.

45. tum meae...] ‘Then too I, so but I speak aught worth
hearing, shall j oin in with the best portion of my utterance,' meae
is emphatic in its position: you shall take the chief part, and
then even I shall venture to join in.

'ffie ijections to this rendering are two ; (1) tuque has but

’ little MSS. authority, (2) it is urged that the words dum procedis

can only apply to the triumphator or the triumphal proeession.
I am certainly of opinion that they can refer to Antonius.
Horace has been referring to Antonius all through as taking
the lead in the praise of Augustus: you, he says, shall sing
Caesar's fame, Ι will join in (accedet). Surely then he can
speak of him as ‘taking tho lead‚' (procedo expressing his
‘going in front’ of Horace and the train of citizens in the
procession, and suggesting his ‘taking the lead’ in singing the
triumphal hymn) when Horace and the rest of the state join
in celelbrating Caesar’s triumph and accompanying it to the
Ca ito .

pThe other reading is teque, dum procedis (or procedit, Orelli),
where te is referred to Triumphe, Triumphus being personified
(cf. Epod. 9. 21, Io Triumphe, tu ‘moraris aureos currus), and pro-
cedis referring to the advance of the procession, or, if procedit be
read, to the general. I give Wickham’s rendering3 ‘Thy name
will we pronounce as thy procession passes by, Ho Triumph!
again and again Ho Triumphl’

The fatal objection to this rendering 13 not the difficulty
of extracting the vocative Triumphe from the cry Io Triumphe
in order to find something for te to refer to, but the im-
possibility of referring te to any one but Antonius. Antonius
has been addressed in the 2nd person in line 2, again in
line 26, again in lines 33 and 41: the te which is placed
with such marked prominence at the beginning of this stanza
