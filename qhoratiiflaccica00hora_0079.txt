N OTES. 69

muneribus oriente toto, interdicta amicitia a Caio Caesare,
Auyusti filio, venenum biberet, ut neptis eius quadringenties
HS. operta spectaretur ad lucernas. That he left behind him
so great a fortune does not in any way prove Velleius' account
of his life-long rascality and dissimulation: it was the practice
of great Romans to amass fortunes by plundering provinces.
Moreover even if Lollius did while thus engaged profess and
hold high philosophie views on the blessings of poverty-—as
Horace's h'nes perhaps suggest—we know from the case of
Seneca how easy} such inconsistency is.

But indeed it is scarcely worth while enquiring what
Lollius’ real character was, and whether Horace was deceived
in him (as Lucretius Ea} in Memmius) or no ε the concluding
lines of the Ode, though professing to describe Lollius, are
really the description of an ideal. Lollius was the friend of
Augustus and at that time certainly held in high esteem:
Horace had to send him an Ode and praise his virtues, and
naturally finds it easier to pen a sketch of perfect virtue
instead. Odes, DedicationS‚ Testimonials, and the like more
often present to us the writer-'s idea of what a man should be,
than a description oi* what a particular man is.
