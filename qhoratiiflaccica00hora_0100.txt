90 HORACE, ODES IV. xv.

forbids its separation from increpuit. No doubt, as Horace is a
lyric poet, loqui iszloqui (lyra) ‘to tell of (in lyric poetry).’ but
this is not expressed, though perhaps suggested by the addition
of lyra to increpuit: Apollo fitly employs the lyre to warn
Horace against the misuse of that instrument.

cf. Virg. Georg. 2. 41, pelagyoque vo ans cla vela patenti..

Caesar] Augustus was a ‘Caesar’ as being the adppted s-on

so many modern languages, eg. Kaiser‚ Caar, Shah.

the fields in safety.
